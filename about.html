                        My name is Josh Myers and I have a goal of moving to Germany after getting my bachelors degree. I want this because of personal preference in government policy. There are many issues prevalent in the United States that are near non-existent in many other places in the world. For example, in the US unless you are relatively wealthy, there is an ever present risk of a medical emergency causing severe financial strain and even bankruptcy.

                    <h3>Goal of website:</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        I made this website to help research more about the process of moving to and visiting Germany. This is meant to be more of a jumping off point for further research, so most of it won't be in depth.
