      I am currently in my third semester at the Northwestern campus and I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s in computer science. I don’t quite know what my end goal for my career is however I am interested in software development and cloud computing.

      My hobbies include playing games similar to RimWorld, reading, and listening to music. The next book I will be reading is by Joe Abercrombie called The Devils. I only recently found it, but my favorite song is Everything Goes On by Porter Robinson. I’m also interested in learning to play the piano at some point in the near future.
