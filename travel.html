                <ul>
                    <li>Public transportation is widely used in Germany so make sure you look for train and bus tickets.</li>
                    <li>As odd as it may seem, many public bathrooms require payment of some kind. The bathrooms that will ask for paymeny will usually be behing a turnstyle. Some also have someone posted outside asking for tips, these are optional.</li>
                    <li>Many places in germany don't accept card, so you should plan to use cash as the primary form of currency.</li>
                    <li>Germany runs on a different electrical system and you will need a step-down converter for your plugs. Be careful to check that your converter is capable of changing the elecrical frequency</li>
